# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Analytics
✨ Welcome to my Hospital Readmission Analytics project, where complex patient data is transformed into actionable healthcare insights using MySQL. This project showcases how powerful SQL queries and KPIs can help hospitals understand patient patterns, optimize care, and reduce costly readmissions — turning raw data into smarter health decisions.

## ✨ Project Overview
-  Identify age groups and diagnoses with higher readmission rates  
-  Analyze medication and lab test effects on patient readmissions  
-  Understand how outpatient and emergency visits relate to readmission risk

## 🔍 Key Insights Uncovered
- Readmission Patterns:
  Patients aged 40-50 have the highest readmission rates (around 0.4%), with rates decreasing in older age groups.

- Medication Impact:
  Patients with changes in diabetes medication show higher readmission rates (49.35%) compared to those without changes (47.77%).

- Primary Diagnoses:
  Circulatory conditions are the most common cause of hospitalization, followed by respiratory and digestive issues.

## 📂 Why This Project Matters
Hospital readmission isn’t just a statistic — it reflects patient health, care quality, and system efficiency.

This project helps to:

- Reveal key factors driving readmissions

- Support better care planning and resource management

- Turn complex hospital data into actionable insights
